# Final project website

Here there is a link to my project <a href='https://preview.shorthand.com/lpoNjDKQwfNvhE5L'>Diversity at Carnegie Mellon: Perspectives from a Latinx student</a>

# Wireframes / Storyboards

I found Shorthand extremely useful in telling my story. While presenting my initial Shorthand draft to my peers in class, I got good feedback about reorganizing my story's phases, so I changed it accordingly. The outcome is much more engaging.

# Charts

First, I wanted to explain my choice of one for my first chart, as we discussed being cautious while using **pie charts**. The difference between international and national graduate students is notorious, so the pie chart clearly transmits that illusion. My interviewees exclaimed 'wow' each time I presented the chart. That's the effect I want to create on them for anticipation because my topic digs deep in the opposite way. Then, their shock will be stronger.

Regarding the population chart, I chose the **icon map** because it was a creative way of generating audience engagement. It is also easily associated with the population.

Next, I decided to do a simple **bar chart** for the Universities because here, as I am stating my problem, I want my point to be straightforward.

As I started from a personal view, I want to expand to other student's opinions on diversity at the University. I asked a varied sample of different ethnicities to position themselves on the first day they arrived at CMU and to think about how they felt about diversity. The responses were quite interesting, so I made an **infogram.** 

For my university comparison, I used multiple-column charts/stacked charts.

Next, as I dug deeper into the problems, I knew the topic could get a little boring because of the amount of information. So, I did an animation with two maps showcasing different metrics, such as the Gini index and educational attainment.

I made another **infogram** for the University ranking because it is an attractive way to compare information and make it stand out.

# User research 

## Target audience

My story is personal. But, as the saying goes, 'the personal becomes political'. So, my main goal is not only to gather the attention of the Latinx community at CMU but as it's an issue that should worry us all, from every student at the University.

Second, I would also want to transmit my message to the admissions department at CMU, as they are the main stakeholders in increasing Latinx presence on Campus.

## Interview script

My aim for the interviews was first to understand if I was fulfilling my personal goals with this project:
* Understand if the topic was compelling to everyone. I am a Latinx and feel strongly about the lack of Latinxs on Campus. So, I might be biased toward the importance of the topic.
* Confirm if 'Affirmative Action' captivates the audience's interest and doesn't generate negative reactions.
* Make the audience want to participate in solving this issue.
* Generate highs and lows in the audience's emotions.

Second, to receive feedback about my structure, aesthetics and charts.

|-------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------          |                       
| Compelling topic and story?                 | What excited you the most?<br>What resonated with you the most?<br>What surprised you?<br>What would you change? |
| Affirmative action reaction?                | Check their reaction and ask them how they feel with it? |
| Make the audience want to<br>participate in solving<br>this issue?   | What made you curious and which would be your next steps<br>if any? |



## Interview findings

### Interview 1

| Questions                        | Latinx - 30s - CMU Graduate Student      |                     
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------           
| What excited you the most?       | The information the story has, the data showcased. |
| What resonated with you the most?| The low percentage of Latinxs was shocking |
| What would you change?           | Aesthetics in infographics, the infographic about university rankings is not clear  enough. |
| Affirmative action reaction?     | It was really interesting to understand more on the topic. Now I want to do more research about it. |
| What made you curious and<br>which would be your next steps if any? | To research more about the disparty of US population and CMU population      | 

### Interview 2

| Questions                        | Asian - 30s - CMU Graduate Student |                          
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------           
| What excited you the most?       | 'The data is extremely interesting.' |
| What resonated with you the most? | 'I think 'Asians' as an ethnicity is too broad, because I feel I'm also underepresented and I'm from Southeast Asia. But I'm interested in the topic.' |
| What would you change?           | 'The structure of the story is a bit confusing. I would reorganize it. Also, I would stick only to the Gini index and not the educational attainment nor the rankings.' |
| Affirmative action reaction?     |  'It was wrong, I think it's interesting to understand how we are going to make it better now' |
| What made you curious and which would be your next<br>steps if any? |  'The CMU resources, I didn't know there were actions being taken.' |

### Interview 3

| Questions                                        | Asian - 30s - CMU Phd |                        
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|          
| What excited you the most?                       | 'The graphs depicting diversity' |
| What resonated with you the most?                | 'Educational attainment by country' |
| What would you change?                           | - |
| Affirmative action reaction?                     |  'Good to describe it as “wicked” problem, but does your audience know this design term? If so, then ok.'  |
| What made you curious and which would be your next steps if any? | 'It was interesting to learn about rankings as a potential reason for lack of diversity, but I am not sure what step to take next.' |




# Identified changes for Part III 

* On a final note, I think I'm on the right track. I need to continue doing interviews and focusing more on the outcomes. What will the achievable next step be for students to do something about this interesting issue?


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                         |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of information of what steps to take after seeing this | Focusing more on the call to actions, give more options, do more interviews with key stakeholders of diversity (admissions, 'The center', etc.) |
| Structure is not compelling enough, and it's mixing | Continue reorganizing the structure of the story to make it more compelling. |
| Infographics are not clear enough | Improve the infographics aesthetic, and make them stand out. Clarify the ranking infographic to make it more contrasting. |
