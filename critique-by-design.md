# Critique by design - Gender Gap in developed countries

Looking for gender gap visualizations, I found <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/4279/the-gender-pay-gap-in-developed-nations-visualised/" target="_blank">this chart</a> that has important information regarding the difference in salaries between men and women in developed countries.

# Is the information engaging for Statista's audience?

* Yes. The overall information is interesting and useful for the audience as it refers to a sublet of ‘developed countries’, making them notice that development doesn’t necessarily imply wage equity. But, according to Statista’s mission, they ‘enable our clients and customers to make the best decisions’, so I think it should be more accurate and less cluttered.


# A few key observations:

* Although I think the bar chart works well and is accurate and the label’s grey colour and font are clear, I don’t like the aesthetics. There are a lot of unnecessary resources: the font size is too big, different colors, the map is irrelevant, and the flags and extra icons. I would reduce the amount of noise this visualization has, making it more minimalistic and take away the distracting colors.
  
* Also, I would include ‘selected developed countries’ to make it more accurate for Statista's audience of decision makers. I don’t understand what metric they are using for selecting developed countries as Korea is not a developed country according to OECD.
  
* Finally, an important issue is the chart's date is not clear.

# My sketch

I used the new tool presented: Infogram. I found it useful and fast, but I still prefer Flourish. I took into account all the things I wanted to change from the critique exercise and applied them to my new sketch.

* Reduced colors and visual clutter.
* Added colors only for highlighting the average and the worst country in terms of salaries gender gap.
* I curated the data to represent better developed countries according to several sources.
* I set the date, 2021, as a principal asset.

# Gathering feedback

Overall they liked my new design.

**Student, Late-20's**

* 'The title is misleading because it suggest that the gender gap is worse in developed countries. I would interchange the subtitle with the title'

* 'Is Latvia highlighted because is the worst?'

**Student, Late-20's**

* 'What is OECD? Could you explain it somewhere? Also clarify that the blue value is an average'

**Student, Mid-20's**

* 'Use white for higher contrast with gray'

**Student, Late-20's**

* 'Why are you highlighting Latvia? If it is highlighted I would say something about Latvia in the subtitle.','Get rid of the lines, you already have the percentages on each bar','White percentages for higher contrast','Highlight the top 3 and make gray more notorious', 'Explicit that the blue value is the average'

**Researcher, Late-30's**

* 'Your x-label should be the title, is much more catchy.' 'I want to see the % metric upfront', 'Is it 24 cents less than a dolar? That's horrible.' (engagement)

# My new redesign

### Design and aesthetics ###

* I maintained the bar chart, because I think it communicates accurately the information to the audience. I took away the colors and set an animation to highlight the worst gap country only after the user gets to understand the visualization. I also changed the percentage's colors and explained the average.
  
* I didn't explained what is OECD because it was too long and unimportant. I decided to take it from the barchart, and only cite it in the source section. I also didn't highlighted the top 3, because I thought it was going to be misleading.

* I added a captivating footer.

### Header ###

* I redefined the title and subtitle to be more engaging and clear.

### Conclusion ###

My redesign is more sober and clear, representing accurately what Statista's audience want to see for making decisions.
