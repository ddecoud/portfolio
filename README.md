_Igniting technology

***HI, I’M A BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEADER WITH 3+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.***

As a curious and lifelong learner I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Integrated Innovation for Products & Services at Carnegie Mellon University.

# What I hope to learn
 
I am a lifelong learner. I grew up doing ‘experiments’ and knowing I wanted to be a scientist. At 16, my focus switched to field hockey, where I forged my tenacity and quest for excellence by representing Uruguay in the Pan American Youth Championship. Meanwhile, in high school, I discovered Philosophy and was immediately hooked on its coverage of life’s enigmas.

However, my interest in science kept growing, and, uncertain about job opportunities in Philosophy, I started studying Food Engineering. Due to certain career twists, I obtained an undergraduate degree in Accounting from the School of Economics and took a sabbatical to travel across the globe.

After multiple life pivots, I became the Head of Product at a fintech startup and was awarded the global ‘Women that Build’ Globant Award in the Rising Star category in Uruguay for demonstrating innovation through technology and potential as a role model.

Product management is, for me, the perfect mix between a scientist and a philosopher and having the chance to creatively improve people's lives. Due to my career and academic journey, I have received a Fulbright scholarship to specialize in it at Carnegie Mellon University.

As a very empathetic product leader, I am whole-heartedly dedicated to making customer's lives easier. Having worked with new or existing products, I manage my multicultural teams using Lean-Agile frameworks. As a natural team builder, I align people toward developing innovative products that solve real-world problems while being valuable to the business.
