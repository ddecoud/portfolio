***HI, Iâ€™M A BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEADER WITH 3+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.***


As a curious, lifelong learner and due to my career and academic journey, I have received a Fulbright scholarship to pursue a Master's in Integrated Innovation for Products & Services at Carnegie Mellon University.



# What I hope to learn
 
As a Product Manager, data is one of my core assets when making product decisions. However, sometimes it is hard to communicate those findings in an attractive way that engages your managers and investors. I want to become better at communicating and storytelling and start influencing product decisions through data.
