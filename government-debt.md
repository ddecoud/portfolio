# Differences between Data Visualizations

Across these charts, we see each country's general government's gross debt as a percentage of GDP, according to the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm" target="_blank">OECD</a>. Although the bar charts in the original visualization are clear and easy to read, it is difficult to understand the variations in countries' debt across time. 

The grid of charts in the second option aims to solve this problem of 'progression'. However, I think it is not easily readable for the user. Thus, I chose a dynamic chart. The first time I saw this dataset, I immediately knew I wanted to know how the specific composition of the debt's ranking had changed over time. My option makes it easier for the user to follow a country across time regarding improvement/deterioration of debt over GPD.
